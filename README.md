# Implications of latrine access on the improvement of linear childhood growth due to sanitation interventions in rural Kenya and Bangladesh

## Executive Summary

### Background 
Diarrheal disease continues to disproportionately burden developing nations. The high prevalence of these preventable
diseases is often attributed to poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in affected communities. Diarrheal disease has been linked to
linear growth faltering in children, but no previous studies have looking into the causal relationship between improved sanitation and
increased length-for-age z-scores (LAZ).

### Problem 
The external validity of a 2013 WASH Benefits study was called into question due to the preexisting improved latrines that existed
in participating villages. The original findings concluded that sanitation interventions, both in isolation and in combination with other
WASH and nutrition efforts, had no significantly impact on childhood growth. Arguments against the results were published, claiming that
latrine status at enrollment reduced the potential impact that improved sanitation has on childhood growth.

### Methods 
A reanalysis of data collected in the control group of the initial WASH Benefits will be completed. Calculations will be made to
find the unadjusted and adjusted differences in LAZ between households that had improved latrines at baseline and households that did not
have improved latrines at baseline.

### Results 
The mean LAZ measurements were still low across the board after stratifying data for latrine status at enrollment. There were
significantly significant LAZ differences in households with improved latrines at baseline relative to households that did not have improved
latrines.

### Conclusion 
Children in households with improved sanitation structures still faced poor growth outcomes. Improved latrines did result in a
significant improvement in mean LAZ, but many other determinants need to be considered in order to put LAZ measurements at a “healthy”
level. Global sanitation efforts are still crucial to the development of equitable societies, even if there is not a strong link between improved
sanitation and a reduction in childhood linear growth faltering.
